# ‚öΩ Football Match Prediction System

A full-stack AI/ML project that predicts the outcome of English Premier League (EPL) football matches using XGBoost classification based on historical performance, win ratios, and goal differences. This is **Phase 1** of a production-ready system designed with real-world deployment in mind.

---

## üöÄ Features (Phase 1)

- üì• Fetches and flattens raw match data from Football API
- üßº Cleans and engineers features like win ratios and goal differentials
- üß† Trains a machine learning model (XGBoost) on past matches
- üîç Predicts match outcomes (Home win, Away win, Draw)
- üß™ Logs predictions and allows model retraining from feedback
- üßæ Fully containerized via Docker
- üìä Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- üåê FastAPI backend with deployed API endpoints

---

## üîó Live Demo

- üß† **API (FastAPI on Render)**: [football-predictor-api.onrender.com/docs](https://football-predictor-api.onrender.com/docs)
- üìä **Dashboard (Streamlit)**: Coming soon in Phase 2

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- XGBoost
- FastAPI
- Streamlit
- Docker
- Render (Deployment)
- Git, GitHub

## üì¶ Setup & Deployment

1. Clone the repository  
2. Create `.env` file with your Football API key  
3. Install requirements:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run FastAPI backend:  
   ```bash
   uvicorn api.main:app --reload
   ```
5. Run Streamlit dashboard:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

## üîÆ Next Steps (Phase 2)

- üîÅ Automate model retraining from logs
- üîÑ Add CI/CD pipelines
- üîê Secure API with token-based auth
- üìä Deploy Streamlit dashboard
- üìÖ Add fixture-based batch prediction system
