# ⚽ Football Match Prediction System

A full-stack AI/ML project that predicts the outcome of English Premier League (EPL) football matches using XGBoost classification based on historical performance, win ratios, and goal differences. This is **Phase 1** of a production-ready system designed with real-world deployment in mind.

---

## 🚀 Features (Phase 1)

- 📥 Fetches and flattens raw match data from Football API
- 🧼 Cleans and engineers features like win ratios and goal differentials
- 🧠 Trains a machine learning model (XGBoost) on past matches
- 🔍 Predicts match outcomes (Home win, Away win, Draw)
- 🧪 Logs predictions and allows model retraining from feedback
- 🧾 Fully containerized via Docker
- 📊 Interactive Streamlit dashboard
- 🌐 FastAPI backend with deployed API endpoints

---

## 🔗 Live Demo

- 🧠 **API (FastAPI on Render)**: [football-predictor-api.onrender.com/docs](https://football-predictor-api.onrender.com/docs)
- 📊 **Dashboard (Streamlit)**: Coming soon in Phase 2

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- XGBoost
- FastAPI
- Streamlit
- Docker
- Render (Deployment)
- Git, GitHub

## 📦 Setup & Deployment

1. Clone the repository  
2. Create `.env` file with your Football API key  
3. Install requirements:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run FastAPI backend:  
   ```bash
   uvicorn api.main:app --reload
   ```
5. Run Streamlit dashboard:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```

---

## 🔮 Next Steps (Phase 2)

- 🔁 Automate model retraining from logs
- 🔄 Add CI/CD pipelines
- 🔐 Secure API with token-based auth
- 📊 Deploy Streamlit dashboard
- 📅 Add fixture-based batch prediction system
